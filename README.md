Applied Project: Database Management for a Company.
In this project, I focused on end-to-end database management for a Company using MySQL and SQL queries. My responsibilities included cleaning and managing data, populating database tables with accurate values, and visualizing data to provide actionable insights. Additionally, I was involved in managing the company's sales records and income data, ensuring that the database was both functional and optimized for performance.
